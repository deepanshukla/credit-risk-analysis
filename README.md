## Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning

Hey! This is a simple machine learning project I worked on to predict whether a person is likely to default on their credit payment.
The dataset I used in this project is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients. 

## What this project does

- Loads and cleans credit risk data.
- Preprocesses the data (label encoding, scaling, fixing weird values)
- Trains a few ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - Gradient Boosting
  - K-Nearest Neighbors

- Compares their performance with metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Plots graphs for visual representation.
